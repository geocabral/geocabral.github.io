<p>Among the more often modules taught in the past few years, are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>

    <p><em>Abstract:</em> This module is divided in two major topics: Search and Machine Learning algorithms. The idea is to provide the student with broad AI concepts so that at the end of the course he/she is able to identify the situations in whiche the use of the most popular AI techiniques may be applied.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Neural Networks</strong></p>

    <p><em>Abstract:</em> In this module, a specific understanding about the most popular neural network algorithms is provided along with the underlying math behind each NN type. At the end of the course, the student must be capable to understand mechanisms inside each NN type so that he/she is able to properly apply the techniques to real world problems according to the problemsâ€™ characteristics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Computing Theory</strong></p>

    <p><em>Abstract:</em> This module is intended in providing the student with theoretical foundations of computing. Among the covered topics are: Automata theory, Regular Expressions, Context-free grammars, Turing Machines, Halting problem and P, NP and NP hard, and NP complete problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Programming</strong></p>

    <p><em>Abstract:</em> This is aimed at providing the student with initial programming skills. As outcome, the student must be able to translate a simple real world procedure to programming languages suchas as C or Python.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
